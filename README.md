# 重要信息
本主站修改自IGH1.6，完成了在6.5.2版本内核下的，r8169，e1000e，igc，igb实时网卡
驱动的支持，目前已知一个BUG，r8169网卡在拔网线后，无法自动重连从站，不拔网线没有问题。


# Important Information
This master station is modified from IGH 1.6 and has completed support for 
real-time network card drivers, including r8169, e1000e, igc, and igb, 
on the 6.5.2 kernel version. Currently, a known bug exists: the r8169 network card 
cannot automatically reconnect to the slave after the network cable is unplugged. 
However, it works fine without unplugging the cable.



# General Information

This is an open-source EtherCAT master implementation for Linux 2.6 or newer.

See the [features file](FEATURES.md) for a list of features. For more
information, see http://etherlab.org/en/ethercat.

# Documentation

## Handbook

The PDF documentation is generated via LaTeX and can be build with the
following steps:

```bash
cd documentation
make
```

The PDF is automatically held up-to-date and can be [downloaded from
GitLab](https://gitlab.com/etherlab.org/ethercat/-/jobs/artifacts/stable-1.5/raw/pdf/ethercat_doc.pdf?job=pdf).

## Doxygen

To generate the Doxygen documentation, the following commands can be used.
Therefore, the configure script must have run (see the [install
file](INSTALL.md)).

```bash
git submodule update --init
make doc
```

An up-to-date Doxygen output can be found on
[docs.etherlab.org](https://docs.etherlab.org/ethercat/1.5/doxygen/index.html).

# Requirements

## Software requirements

Configured sources for the Linux 2.6 (or newer) kernel are required to build
the EtherCAT master.

## Hardware requirements

A table of supported hardware can be found at
http://etherlab.org/en/ethercat/hardware.php.

# Building and installing

See the [install file](INSTALL.md).

# Realtime and Tuning

Realtime patches for the Linux kernel are supported, but not required. The
realtime processing has to be done by the calling module (see API
documentation). The EtherCAT master code itself is passive (except for the
idle mode and EoE).

To avoid frame timeouts, deactivating DMA access for hard drives is
recommended (`hdparm -d0 <DEV>`).
